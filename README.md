## Overview
This work proposes that the microstates of a Schwarzschild black hole are distinguishable configurations of Weyl curvature correlations across the horizon. The number of such microstates is asymptotically given by the integer partition function \( p(n) \), leading to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law \( S = A/(4\ell_P^2) \) and a unique logarithmic correction with coefficient -2.

## Key Result
The derivation yields the relation:
\[
n = \frac{3}{32\pi^2} \left( \frac{A}{\ell_P^2} \right)^2
\]
where \( n \) is the number of accessible curvature correlation units.
