**Deriving Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy from Conformal Curvature Partitions**

This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper proposing a geometric-informational derivation of black hole entropy via integer partitions of conformal curvature correlations.

## Abstract
We propose that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy enumerates distinguishable conformal curvature configurations of a black hole horizon. The model posits that horizon microstates are holistic patterns of Weyl curvature, encoded in $n$ independent curvature correlation units and enumerated by the integer partition function $p(n)$. The area law uniquely determines $n \propto A^2$, reproducing $S_{\text{BH}} = A/(4\ell_P^2)$ and predicting a universal logarithmic correction with coefficient $-2$.

## Key Features
- Novel geometric-informational approach to black hole entropy
- Derivation from integer partitions of curvature correlations
- Prediction of logarithmic correction coefficient $-2$
- Comparison with quantum gravity approaches
