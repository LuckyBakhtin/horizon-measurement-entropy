# The Measurement Interpretation of Black Hole Entropy: A Grazing Photon's Limited View

This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper proposing a geometric-informational derivation of black hole entropy via integer partitions of conformal curvature correlations.

## Abstract
We propose an operational interpretation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_{\mathrm{BH}} = A/(4\ell_P^2)$ as the maximum information measurable by a null probe grazing the event horizon. Modeling the horizon's information content as Planck-scale curvature correlations, we posit that a photon can only distinguish holistic correlation patterns enumerated by the integer partition function $p(n)$. Equating the observable entropy $\ln p(n)$ to $S_{\mathrm{BH}}$ reveals that the probe can resolve patterns built from $n = k N^2$ correlation units, where $k = 3/(32\pi^2) \approx 0.009499$. Thus, the area law reflects not the total information content, but the finite fraction ($\sim 0.9499\%$) accessible before the photon is captured. The model yields a universal logarithmic correction with coefficient $-2$.

- Novel geometric-informational approach to black hole entropy
- Derivation from integer partitions of curvature correlations
