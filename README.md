## Abstract
If black hole entropy follows the Boltzmann formula $S = \ln \Omega$, what microstates does $\Omega$ count? For a Schwarzschild black hole, this question is sharpened by a fundamental constraint: microstates must be distinguishable by measurement.
We propose that the microstates are distinct, holistic configurations of curvature correlations across the horizon, distinguishable to a massless probe on a grazing null geodesic. The number of such microstates is asymptotically given by the integer partition function $p(n)$, where $n$ represents the number of independent pairwise correlations between Planck areas that are accessible to measurement. Requiring that $\ln p(n)$ satisfy the Bekenstein-Hawking area law forces the scaling $n \propto (A/\ell_P^2)^2$, with the precise relation $n = \frac{3}{32\pi^2} (A/\ell_P^2)^2$. This approach exactly reproduces the area law and uniquely predicts a universal logarithmic correction with coefficient $-2$, giving the entropy $S = \frac{A}{4\ell_P^2} - 2\ln\left( \frac{A}{\ell_P^2} \right) + \text{constant}$. This distinguishes it from specific quantum gravity models. The result suggests that black hole entropy may be an inherent geometric property, arising from the holographic encoding of curvature correlations on the horizon.

## Overview
This work proposes that the microstates of a Schwarzschild black hole are distinguishable configurations of Weyl curvature correlations across the horizon. The number of such microstates is asymptotically given by the integer partition function $\( p(n) \)$, leading to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law $\( S = A/(4\ell_P^2) \)$ and a unique logarithmic correction with coefficient -2.

## Key Result
The derivation yields the relation:

$\[n = \frac{3}{32\pi^2} \left( \frac{A}{\ell_P^2} \right)^2
\]$ where $\( n \)$ is the number of accessible curvature correlation units.
